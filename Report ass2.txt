The dynamic programming method we've put into action aims to align two gene sequences, x and y, by achieving the best possible alignment score. To do this, our algorithm builds matrices to store scores and trace the alignment path efficiently. It utilizes dynamic programming, considering three moves at each step: a diagonal move representing a match/mismatch, a move to the left indicating a gap in sequence y, and a move upwards denoting a gap in sequence x. The scoring matrix provided guides the assignment of scores for nucleotide matches, mismatches, and gap penalties, aiding the algorithm in finding the most optimal alignment.

In terms of time, our dynamic programming algorithm has a time complexity of O(mn), where m and n stand for the lengths of sequences x and y, respectively. This complexity is due to the nested loops used to compute scores for each cell within the matrices. Our method efficiently computes the highest-scoring alignment, taking a reasonable amount of time proportional to the product of the input sequence lengths. This efficiency allows us to effectively handle moderately sized gene sequences without compromising computational speed.
